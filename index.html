It was founded in 1860 by the Jesuits under the supervision of Rev.Fr.Henri Depelchin, and it is named after Francis Xavier, a 16th-century Jesuit missionary to India. The school completed its sesquicentennial year in 2010.</p>

For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.</p>

                    The canteen service is framed within the Educational Project of the school and includes two different areas: the dining room and the activities that children carry out at midday hours, both under the control, surveillance and animation of the monitors.

                    This service also aims to provide students with balanced nutrition, helping them live together during dinner and leisure activities. That is why, from the dining room, a healthy and balanced diet is encouraged, as well as correct eating habits.

                    From the school we manage and coordinate the dining service at the level of registrations, cancellations, modifications and global operation and delegates, to the company HOSTESA, the management, the monitoring, the activities and the elaboration of the food. </p>
